# A Resume Ready To Be Reformatted
It was always a lot of frustration modifying my resume because it would always mean a whole lot of tiny manual changes to get things to look right. I wanted to be able to style it with CSS in a browser, so I defined all the data in JSON and built a react front-end to display it. A great tool for learning react is Scrimba and the various lessons to be found thereon.

# Printing notes
Number one is that I couldnt make break-before, page-break-before or their variants actually do anything inside of the grid layout. I gave up after about an hour of messing with it. 

Number two is that the print-to-pdf (via windows Microsoft PDF writer) *looks way better from firefox than from Chrome*. ymmv of course.

# React simple setup

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack with a hot reloading dev server:

```
$ npm start
```
