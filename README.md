# A Resume Ready To Be Reformatted
It was always a lot of frustration modifying my resume because it would always mean a whole lot of tiny manual changes to get things to look right. I wanted to be able to style it with CSS in a browser, so I defined all the data in JSON and built a react front-end to display it. A great tool for learning react is Scrimba and the various lessons to be found thereon.

# React simple setup

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ npm run watch
```
